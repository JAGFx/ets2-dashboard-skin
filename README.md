## About

The idea with this repository is to update a collection of dashboard from the [Funbit repository](https://github.com/Funbit/ets2-telemetry-server) with the newest SCS SDK.

And then, use a best way to maintain the different dashboard.

The first to be rework are my own dashboard. In the future, all dashboard in the *Funbit repository* will be include

This project was based on the [TruckSim-Telemetry-Demo](https://github.com/kniffen/TruckSim-Telemetry-Demo)
