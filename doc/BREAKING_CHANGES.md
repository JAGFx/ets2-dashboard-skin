The configuration field `maps_map_tilesLocation` will be deprecated.

Use the `maps_map_tilesRemoteCustomPath` instead.

## v1.6.0+
It's not be planned, but a major change was introduced and cause a breaking change.

From `v1.6.X` and more, there will not be able to work with the old map tiles collection (under `v1.5.X`)

Please download the latest map tiles collection before to use the Map skin.
